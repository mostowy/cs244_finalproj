# cs244_finalproj
CS244 Final Project by Walter Mostowy and Nathan Butler

Todo List:
  - Implement BucketsTable efficiently (not sure how they do that...)...
  - Edit Timing.h to print stats and do what we need it to for the filters (maybe only do false positive rate and max on it)
  - Build rest of filters....
